# Discord-Webhook-Client
This is a "client" that can send messages within Discord with Discord webhooks.

How to use:
  First, you will have to create a Discord webhook. Then, choose a channel where you would like to create your webhook. 
  Then go to "Edit Channel" > "Intergrations" > "Webhooks" > "New Webhook".
   
  Once you have successfully created a webhook then copy the webhook URL by clicking on the "Copy Webhook URL" button.
  After that open the application and paste in the webhook URL.
  
  Boom! That is all the setup! Now knock yourself out! Not literally...
